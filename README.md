# Requirements
- Vagrant 2.1+
- VirtualBox 5.0+

# Setup

Setup the project's development environment:

```bash
$ ./scripts/setup
```

`setup` will provision a Vagrant VM, using `vboxsf` to mount `./` (relative to `Vagrantfile`) to `/vagrant`, as well as `~/.aws` to `/home/vagrant/.aws`.

After running `setup`, you can access the VM by running:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$
```

## Setting Development Environment Variables

The `.env.template` file is a template file with environment variables that get injected into running containers during development. This needs to be copied into a file named `.env` and provisioned with a Mapbox API token. 

# Development

To start the application, run:

```bash
# Access the VM console
$ vagrant ssh

# Start the application
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ ./scripts/server
```

## Hot Reloading ðŸ”¥

Because the frontend uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/), which integrates with webpack, the page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. 

In development, the backend uses [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io) to monitor for any source code changes and will automatically restart the API server.

## Indexing production database
- connect to prod database, update .env file
- Uncomment indexing code in `addressSchema.js`, `factorySchema.js` and `geoSchema.js`
- In app.js, comment out `// if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {` and `// } else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { Raven.config(process.env.SENTRY_KEY).install()}`
- Run $`NODE_ENV=production node src/app.js`


## Upload a batch of files in for each account
Uncomment `routes.js`, `app.get('/uploadMultipleFiles', temp.uploadMultipleFiles);`
Create a folder `files` at the root directory, put all the CSV files in it.
Update `accounts` in `uploadFiles.js` with your uid, file_name, file_description, csv_file_name.
`csv_file_name` is the name of the CSV file in the `files` folder

```
GET localhost:8000/uploadMultipleFiles
```
